I created an application that uses an API to get the weather depending on the location of the user. 

For this project I used the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/). 
This site made it easy to get an API key. 

Interactivity: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Location: The user is asked if they'll share their location. 
If user allows location sharing: then current weather is fetched from API
If user doesn't allow location sharing: Error States: User denied geolocation. 
(This API uses location by latitude and longitude degrees)

*Mouse Click: Using EventListener when mouse is clicked the temperature is changed from Farenheit to Celsius. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The weather icons I used are in the filed named 'icons'. 

style.css contains the stylesheet with the colors, fonts, padding, & margins. 

javaScript file is name app.js that's the main page that takes care of the user interaction.
