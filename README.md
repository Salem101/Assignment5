For this project I used the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/). 
This site made it easy to get an API key. 

Interactivity: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Location: The user is asked if they'll share their location. 
If user allows location sharing: then current weather is fetched from API
If user doesn't allow location sharing: Error States: User denied geolocation. 
(This API uses location by latitude and longitude degrees)

*Mouse Click: Using EventListener when mouse is clicked the temperature is changed from Farenheit to Celsius.

The weather icons I used are in the filed named 'icons'.
